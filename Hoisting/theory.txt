hoisiting is a phenomena in javascript in which we can access variables and functions 
even before we have initialised it or put some value in it.
so where ever variable is defined we can access it before also.

Even before code starts executing memory is assigned to all the variables.

So this happens because of memory creation phase as in this phase all the variables are 
assigned a memory and their initial value is stored as undefined and it is not updated till 
the moment execution reaches to intialisation part. 
But for the case of functions it is stored as it is in memory creation phase only 
therefore we can even access the function before its declaration.
