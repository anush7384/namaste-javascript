-->Javascript is Synchronous and single threaded language.

-->Everything happens inside an Execution context.

-->Execution Context is divided into two parts:-
1) Memory part also known as variable environment.
2) Code part also known as Thread of Execution. 

--> 2 phases of Execution context :-
1) Memory creation phase
2) Code execution phase

--> When we envoke function a brand new Execution context is created inside global Execution context.
After completion of function its E.C is deleted.
After completion of program global E.C is also deleted.

--> In memory creation phase
initially all the variables are assigned memory and their value is undefined.
functions are fully initiallised in this phase.
