-->when a() function is envoked an execution context is created inside global Execution context
and it is pushed inside stack
in which it again goes to 2 phases and var x is inside this context only it doesnt affect outer variable x 
 
-->After the function has been executed its Execution context is removed from stack and control again goes to 
part where global execution context was stopped now if we access variable x it will 
show the intial value it had in global Execution context only.

After whole program is finished then global execution context also gets removed from Call Stack and deleted.
