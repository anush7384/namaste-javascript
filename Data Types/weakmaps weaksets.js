// difference between maps and weakmaps is that weakmaps only take object as key
// and when reference to that object is not available that object is removed from memory

// weaksets also take objects as values and when reference is not there the object is deleted from memory


// Object.keys(obj) returns an array of keys
// Object.values(obj) returns an array of values
// Object.entries(obj) returns an array of [key,value] pairs.
