// during memory allocation phase a is alloted memory and for placeholder it is assigned undefined
console.log(a); //undefined   

var a = 10;

// console.log(x);
// here the console will be not defined as it has not been defined
// it is different that undefined 
// a has been assigned in memory whereas x is not present inside execution context

// javascript is a loosely typed language it doesnot attach a data type to variable
var x = 10; // x is storing number
x = "anush"// now x is storing string
console.log(x); // output is anush

var b = undefined; // not a good way though it is completely okay
// as undefined means that during program it was not assigned any value
